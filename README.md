# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This week's Challenge required modifications to be made to starter code in order to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The criteria options include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
